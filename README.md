Core Concept
AI as the engine: translation, text suggestions, graphics, fact summaries.
Humans as the filter: verification, ethics, editing.
Daily editions include:
Opening greeting + core values
3 stories (global, justice/democracy, hope/culture)
Quote of the day, fact of the day, hope of the day
Image/meme or short cultural feature
Distribution via Telegram, X (Twitter), Mastodon, mailing list, and word of mouth.
